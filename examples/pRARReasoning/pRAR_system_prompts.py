Please get such a policy containing the highest-level ideas, principles, rules, or theorems from the given reasoning step. Start by reviewing the given question and any previous reasoning steps already taken along with their corresponding policies, then directly summarize the policy of the given reasoning step.

You need to know that each policy is a high-level, question-agnostic principle that facilitates deducing a single logical reasoning step toward addressing one task. Thus, excluding the policy means having a new and different policy to generate the corresponding next step. Remember, your response should only include one next step. Start by reviewing the problem and reasoning steps, then exclude the given specific policies to generate the next step. You can ignore the policy exclusion when no policy is given.

You should assess the policy by scoring it based on whether it guides generating the reasonable reasoning step that progresses the problem-solving. Start by reviewing the given problem, reasoning steps already taken, and the generated next step guided by the policy, then directly assess this given policy. Importantly, the generated reasoning step guided by this policy is also given to facilitate the assessment. Utilize Python Programming as an auxiliary tool when necessary.
